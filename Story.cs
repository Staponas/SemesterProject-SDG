You ask around about what happened and how you can help, and after a few attempts, one of them answers your questions. 
He explains that they arenâ€™t fully sure themselves about what happened but if you are willing to help then he can give you a task.  
He then explains that it would help them out a lot if you could connect a cable, that he points to, to the somewhat nearby power source. 
Although to get there you will have to get through a maze that is in the way. 
After having explained the instructions to you he quickly goes back to work, and then you pick up the cable and approach the maze.
